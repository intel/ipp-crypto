## CMake Build Options

### Common for all operating systems

- `-B<build-dir>` - defines the build directory. This is the directory where CMake puts the generated Microsoft Visual Studio\* solution or makefiles.

- `-DARCH=<ia32|intel64>` - on Linux* OS defines the target architecture for the build of the Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library.
    > **NOTE:** On Windows* OS, use `-G`/`-A`  instead. See the description of these options [below](#windows-os-1).

    > **NOTE:** Due to the significant shift in the industry towards 64-bit architecture, the support of 32-bit libraries is deprecated in the Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography 2021.9 release and targeted to be removed after one year deprecation notice period.

- `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Defines the configuration of the Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library to build:

  - `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=on`: default configuration. It includes the following steps:
    - Build of a dispatched static library with all available optimizations
    - Build of a dispatched dynamic library with all available optimizations
    - Generation of the single-CPU headers (for details, refer to [this](./OVERVIEW.md) section)

  - `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off`: build of one static library per optimization; build of one dynamic library per optimization.

- `-DPLATFORM_LIST="<platform list>"` - optional, works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set. Sets target platforms for the code to be compiled. See the supported platforms list [here](./OVERVIEW.md).

    - Example for Linux\* OS and the IA-32 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="p8;h9"`

    - Example for Linux\* OS and the Intel® 64 architecture:
        `-DPLATFORM_LIST="y8;l9;k0;k1;d1"`
- `-DMBX_PLATFORM_LIST="<platform list>"` - optional, works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set. Sets target platforms for the code to be compiled for [Crypto Multi Buffer library](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md). Please, refer to [Crypto Multi Buffer library target platforms list](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md/#target-optimization-codes-in-function-names) to check the supported platforms.
    - Example:
        `-DMBX_PLATFORM_LIST="k1;l9"`
- `-DNO_CRYPTO_MB:BOOL=TRUE` - optional, turns off the build of [Crypto Multi Buffer library](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md) and, as a consequence, removes all dependencies on OpenSSL library.
- `-DTONGSUO:BOOL=on`, `-DBORINGSSL:BOOL=on` - required only if forks of OpenSSL library are used to resolve OpenSSL dependencies - Tongsuo and BoringSSL respectively. These flags make sense when [Crypto Multi Buffer library](./sources/ippcp/crypto_mb/Readme.md) is built.
> **NOTE:** -DBABASSL:BOOL=on flag is deprecated and targeted to be removed in the future releases. Please use -DTONGSUO:BOOL=on instead.\*.
- `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="<CPU features list>"` - optional, works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set, i.e. only for 1CPU libraries. Enables the CPU feature dispatching mask at compile-time based on the provided list.

   - Currently supported by the library custom features dispatching:
        1. Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) code-path enabling: `IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON`
        2. Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) / Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2) vector extensions of Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) code-paths enabling: `IPPCP_VAES_ON;IPPCP_VCLMUL_ON`.
    - Example:
        `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON"` - this combination enables Intel® AES-NI in all 1CPU libraries, which contains this code path.
    - Example of using a combination of CPU features:
        `-DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON;IPPCP_VAES_ON;IPPCP_VCLMUL_ON"` - in this combination the highest available feature in each 1CPU library will be enabled (e.g. for `"y8"` it’s Intel® AES-NI, for `"l9"` it's Intel® AVX2 VAES, and for `"k1"` - Intel® AVX-512 VAES)
- `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Regulates the build of FIPS-compliant Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library.

  - `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`: enables all FIPS-compliance changes in Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library.
  - `-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library build with such option is not FIPS-compliant.
- `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Enables internal memory allocation and release using `malloc()` and `free()` functions inside Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library selftests.
  - `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=on`: memory management is held by FIPS selftests, all processing APIs should be called with input parameters equal to `NULL`.
  - `-DIPPCP_SELFTEST_USE_MALLOC:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Memory management is held by customer's application, all processing APIs should be called with work buffers of the valid length.
- `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=<on|off>` - optional. Regulates the build of FIPS-compliant  Crypto Multi-buffer Library.

  - `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`: enables all FIPS-compliance changes in Crypto Multi-buffer Library.
  - `-DMBX_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=off`: default configuration. Crypto Multi-buffer Library build with such option is not FIPS-compliant.

- `-DFIPS_CUSTOM_IPPCP_API_HEADER=<redefined_ippcp_api.h>` - optional flag which allows to use FIPS self-tests with IPPCP API with a different prefix to support capabilities of the custom dispatcher generated by Custom Library Tool (Please, note that it is only intended for a very specific use case of [Custom Library](./OVERVIEW.md/#static-library-with-custom-functionality)).The header should contain redefinitions of IPPCP public API, e.g. `#define ippcpGetLibVersion custom_prefix_ippcpGetLibVersion`. The flag is applicable only when IPPCP FIPS mode is enabled (`-DIPPCP_FIPS_MODE:BOOL=on`).

### Windows\* OS

- `-G"<tool-chain-generator>"` - defines the native build system CMake will generate from the input files.
  Refer to CMake [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators) for the Visual Studio\* generators options.

- `-A<x64|Win32>` - for Visual Studio\* 2022+, defines the target architecture for the build of the Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library.

- `-T<Compiler>` - defines the compiler for building.
  For example, to use Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler, specify `-T"Intel C++ Compiler 2024"`.

> **NOTE:** Refer to CMake [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html) for more information on these options.

### Linux\* OS

- `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=<off|on>` - optional. Defines whether the built library is position-dependent or not.

  - `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=off:` default. Position-independent code.

  - `-DNONPIC_LIB:BOOL=on:` position-dependent code.

## Incorporating Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library sources into custom build system

You can include Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library sources into some arbitrary project's CMake build system and build them with it.

Here is the minimal working example:

``` bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

project("test_proj")

# `crypto` is the repository root folder of Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library
add_subdirectory(crypto)
include_directories(crypto/include)

# 'main.cpp' is some arbitrary project's source file
add_executable("test_proj" main.cpp)
# `ippcp_s` is the target name of static library in the Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library build system.
# This static library will be built automatically, when you build your project.
target_link_libraries("test_proj" "ippcp_s")
```

Also you can use the CMake module to find the Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library installed on the system. The module location is `examples/FindIPPCrypto.cmake` and here is the example of its usage:

``` bash
find_package(IPPCrypto REQUIRED MODULE)

if (NOT IPPCRYPTO_FOUND)
   message(FATAL_ERROR "No Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library found on the system.")
endif()

# If Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library is found, the following variables will be defined:
#     `IPPCRYPTO_LIBRARIES` - static library name
#     `IPPCRYPTO_INCLUDE_DIRS` - path to Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library headers
#     `IPPCRYPTO_ROOT_DIR` - library root dir (a folder with 'include' and 'lib' directories)
```
