# Crypto Multi-buffer Library

Currently, the library provides optimized version of the following algorithms:
1. RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, x25519, SM2 multi-buffer algorithms based on Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) integer fused multiply-add (IFMA) operations. This CPU feature is introduced with Intel® Microarchitecture Code Named Ice Lake.
2. SM4 based on Intel(R) Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel(R) AVX-512) GFNI instructions.
3. SM3 based on Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) instructions.
4. RSA, ECDSA(p256) and ECDH(p256) multi-buffer algorithms based Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2) with Intel® AVX-IFMA. Target CPU Code Name is Sierra Forest.

## Multiple Buffers Processing Overview

Some of the cryptography algorithms cannot be parallelized due to their specificity. For example, the RSA algorithm consists of big-number (multi-digit) arithmetic: multi-precision modular multiplications and squaring operations.

Digits of multi-digit numbers are dependent because of carry propagation during arithmetic operations. Therefore, single RSA computation based on general purpose mul/adc instructions is not efficient.

The way to get high-performance implementations of such cryptographic algorithms is a parallel processing using *single instruction, multiple data* (SIMD) architecture. The usage model implies presence of several independent and homogeneous (encryption or decryption) requests for RSA operations, using of SIMD leads to performance improvement.

Multi-buffer processing collects up to eight RSA operations. Each request is computed independently from the others, so it is possible to process several packets at the same time.

This library consists of highly-optimized kernels taking advantage of Intel’s multi-buffer processing and Intel® AVX-512 instruction set.

## Installation

You can install the Crypto Multi-buffer library in two different ways:
1. Installation to the default directories.
   > **Note**: To run this installation type, you need to have appropriate permissions to write to the installation directory.

   Default locations (default values of `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`):
   - Unix:  /usr/local
   - Windows: C:\Program Files\crypto_mb or C:\Program Files (x86)\crypto_mb

   To begin installation, run the command below in the project folder that was specified with `-B`:
   ``` bash
   make install
   ```
   > **Note**: Installation requires write permissions to the build directory to create the installation manifest file. If it is not feasible in your setup, copy the build to the local directory and change permissions accordingly.

2. Installation to your own directory.
   If you want to install the library not by default paths, specify the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable at the configuration step, for example:
   ``` bash
   cmake . -B"../build" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/libcrypto_mb/installation
   ```

You can find the installed files in:

``` bash

├── ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
    ├── include
    |    └── crypto_mb
    |        ├── cpu_features.h
    │        ├── defs.h
    │        ├── ec_nistp256.h
    │        ├── ec_nistp384.h
    │        ├── ec_nistp521.h
    │        ├── ec_sm2.h
    │        ├── ed25519.h
    │        ├── exp.h
    │        ├── fips_cert.h
    │        ├── rsa.h
    │        ├── sm3.h
    │        ├── sm4.h
    │        ├── sm4_ccm.h
    │        ├── sm4_gcm.h
    │        ├── status.h
    |        ├── version.h
    │        └── x25519.h
    └── lib
        └── libcrypto_mb.so
```
> **Note**: This project uses the default `RPATH` settings:
>
> CMake is linking the executables and shared libraries with full `RPATH` to all used
> libraries in the build tree. When installing, CMake will clear the `RPATH` of these
> targets so they are installed with an empty `RPATH`.
> In this case to resolve the Crypto Multi-buffer Library dependency on OpenSSL it is
> necessary to update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the path to the target OpenSSL library.

## Supported Platforms

Crypto multi-buffer library uses multiple implementations of each function, optimized
for various CPUs. Please, refer to [OVERVIEW.md](../../../OVERVIEW.md#cpu-dispatching)

## How to Build

1. Clone the repository from GitHub\* as follows:

   ``` bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/intel/cryptography-primitives
   ```
   and navigate to the `sources/ippcp/crypto_mb` folder.
2. Set the environment variables for one of the supported C/C++ compilers.

   *example for Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler:*

   ```bash
   source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh intel64
   ```

   For details, refer to the [Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler Developer Guide and Reference](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/current/specifying-the-location-of-compiler-components.html).

3. Run CMake on the command line. Use `-B` to specify path to the resulting project.

    ``` bash
    CC=icx CXX=icpx cmake CMakeLists.txt -B_build -DARCH=intel64
    ```
4. Go to the project folder that was specified with `-B` and run `make` to build the library  (`crypto_mb` target).

### Building with Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library

The Crypto Multi-buffer library will be built automatically with Intel® Cryptography Primitives Library if
optimization for Intel® Microarchitecture Code Named Ice Lake/Code Named Sierra Forest are available.
For more information see [Intel Cryptography Primitives Library Build Instructions](../../../BUILD.md)

### CMake Build Options

- Use `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR`,     `OPENSSL_LIBRARIES` and `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` to   override path to OpenSSL\*:

   ``` bash
   cmake . -B"../build"
   -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/openssl/include
   -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/path/to/openssl/lib
   -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/openssl/installation/dir
   ```

- Set `-DOPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE` if static OpenSSL libraries are preferred.

- Use `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` to build of one static/dynamic library per optimization;
See [specific ISA library](../../../OVERVIEW.md#specific-isa-library) for the details about 1CPU libraries build.

- Use `-DMBX_PLATFORM_LIST="<platform list>"` to set target platforms for the code to be compiled.
The flag works only if `-DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off` is set. Please, refer to [Target Optimization Codes in Function Names](#target-optimization-codes-in-function-names) for the supported platforms list.
    - Example:
        `-DMBX_PLATFORM_LIST="k1;l9"`
